## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3 

I enjoyed this lab because we wrote code using variables, 
initialization, arithmetic operators, input, ouput, and functions. 
I didn't have any prior coding experiennce before taking this lab,
so i enjoyed taking what i learned from lecture and utilizing it for this lab.

* Lab 4

This was my second favorite lab because i learned how to create a program using
the entire edit-compile-run-test-release cycle. This was something I learned in
lecture and it helped me build my programming confidence up. We made a guessing game program 
this lab. 

* Lab 6

This was my favorite lab because we wrote code using if statements and 
std::vector<std::string> type coding. We also used command line arguments 
to provide input for my program. We created an online game of blackjack and my
partner and I had a lot of fun with it. I love going to the casino and playing blackjack, so 
it was a very enjoyable and fun lab!
